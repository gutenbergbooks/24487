<h2>THE STORY OF POCAHONTAS AND CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH</h2>

<h3>1. POCAHONTAS</h3>


<p>Long, long ago, when the Indians owned the land, there lived in
Virginia, near the river afterwards called the James, a little girl, the
Princess Pocahontas, daughter of the great chief Powhatan.</p>

<p>Pocahontas was her father's favorite child, and the pet of the whole
tribe; even the fierce warriors loved her sunny ways.</p>

<p>She was a child of nature, and the birds trusted her and came at her
call. She knew their songs, and where they built their nests. So she
roamed the woods, and learned the ways of all the wild things, and grew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>to be a care-free maiden.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h3>2. JOHN SMITH</h3>


<p>In far-away England was a doughty youth, John Smith, who dreamed of
battle and adventure. Though but a boy, he had already fought as a
soldier in the wars of France, and later in Flanders.</p>

<p>And these two, the wild little Indian girl and the warrior boy, now so
far apart, in time were to meet and become great friends.</p>

<p>At home again in Lincolnshire after dangerous travels, the youth still
longed for the strife and glory of the fray.</p>

<p>He retired to a quiet spot in the wood, and lived in a camp of his own
making, where he read tales of war and knights-errant, and in his
enthusiasm fought imaginary enemies. At last he could bear dreaming no
longer, and started off again to roam the world in search of adventure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h3>3. HOW CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH WON HIS SPURS</h3>


<p>He journeyed across France to join the armies fighting the Turks, but
was robbed on the way by false companions, and suffered much hardship.
At last he reached Marseilles, where he took ship with a party of
pilgrims going to the East. A great storm arising, the pilgrims
superstitiously blamed him for it, and threw him overboard. By good
fortune he was able to swim to a small island, whence he was soon
rescued by a Breton ship. He stayed for some time on this ship, taking
part in a sea fight with a Venetian vessel, and received, after the
victory, a share of the spoils.</p>

<p>Now, with money again in his pocket, he wandered through Italy, and then
crossed over to Styria. Here he joined the army of the Emperor Rudolph
and was appointed captain of a company of cavalry, and did good service.</p>

<p>During the siege of the town of Regal, the Turks, who held it,
challenged any captain among the besiegers to come out and fight one of
their champions.</p>

<p>Captain John Smith was chosen to meet the Turk, and on a field before
the town they fought, and the Turk was beaten and lost his head. On the
next day another Turk challenged the victor and was also overthrown. And
then came still a third, who, after a desperate battle, met the same
fate as the other two. For this brave service Prince Sigismund gave the
Captain a coat-of-arms with three Turks' heads as the device. And thus
Captain John Smith won his spurs.</p>

<p>But after this he was less fortunate, for, being wounded, he was taken
prisoner by the Turks and made a slave. In time, however, he escaped and
fled to Russia, and from thence at last found his way home to England
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h3>4. STRANGE TALES OF A STRANGE PEOPLE</h3>


<p>Meanwhile Pocahontas, now grown to be a girl of some twelve years, often
listened eagerly to the stories of the old men of her tribe, who, on
these warm spring days, sat and smoked together, and told of the things
they had done and seen long ago. Some remembered a white-faced people
who, nearly twenty years before, had come to Roanoke Island from no one
knew where,&mdash;men with yellow hair, dressed from head to foot in cumbrous
garments, and bearing wonderful weapons which spat out fire, with much
noise. Many believed them gods, while others thought they were devils.
And Pocahontas listened in wonder, ever curious to hear of this strange
people so unlike her own. The old priest mournfully prophesied that the
strangers, being of some mighty race, would come again from out the
great waters and overrun the whole land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<h3>5. THE COMING OF THE WHITE MAN</h3>


<p>And scarcely had he spoken when it seemed that his warning had come
true, for runners, wildly excited, cried out that a fleet of mighty
winged canoes had been seen afar on the ocean, advancing like great
clouds.</p>

<p>Then Pocahontas, with many of her people, hurried to the hills, and
there, overlooking the sea, they saw in truth three strange craft slowly
sailing up the bay.</p>

<p>These were the ships from England, bringing a new colony, a band of
pioneers, and adventurers in search of gold, to take possession of the
broad lands of America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<h3>6. THE LANDING OF THE COLONISTS&mdash;1607</h3>


<p>That night the ships dropped anchor in the bay. On the morrow the
colonists disembarked, and Captain Gosnold, their leader, claimed the
land in the king's name. Among the first, as one of the Council, was
Captain John Smith, who had again left home in quest of adventure and
glory, this time in the new world. To the eyes of the weary travelers,
after their long voyage across the sea, Virginia, on that bright April
day, seemed a land of promise. With great hopes and renewed courage they
set to work to build the town which they called Jamestown, in honor of
their king,&mdash;a town which lives to this day.</p>

<p>But after a time they grew dissatisfied, for they failed to find the
gold mines they had hoped for. And they became discouraged, and
quarreled, and things began to go ill with them.</p>

<p>To make matters worse Captain Gosnold after a few months sickened and
died.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;"><a name="landing" id="landing">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h3>7. THE AMBUSH</h3>


<p>Fortunately for the good of the colonists, who had completely lost heart
and were anxious to give up the undertaking, Captain John Smith soon
became their leader. Ever active and enterprising, he inspired the
others by his example. He vigorously put things in order, and set the
idlers to work to complete their half-finished houses, and to build the
forts to protect them from the Indians, who now showed a warlike spirit.</p>

<p>Next he went off to explore the country, and to trade with the natives
for corn, for the settlers began to lack food.</p>

<p>On one of these expeditions, when he had gone ashore with an Indian
guide, a band of hostile braves, who had been on the watch among the
trees, lay in wait to attack him, led by Opekankano, Pocahontas's uncle,
while he, unconscious of their presence, gave orders to his men to stay
by the boat and keep a sharp lookout for danger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h3>8. BATTLE WITH THE INDIANS</h3>


<p>Suddenly, in the heart of the deep woods, the stealthy redskins sprang
upon him, shrieking like fierce beasts of prey. And in a moment the
arrows flew thick and fast.</p>

<p>Captain John, though taken unawares, made a brave fight, gravely
wounding two of his enemies with his pistols, and protecting himself
from the arrows by holding his Indian guide in front of him, as a
buckler.</p>

<p>But there were too many against him, and as he could not beat them off
he tried to retreat to the boat, always shielding himself with the
guide. Unfortunately, just as escape seemed near, he stumbled into a
swamp and was held fast by the heavy bog, and chilled by the cold water.
Being thus helpless he was forced to surrender, and the triumphant
Indians seized him as their prisoner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;"><a name="ambush" id="ambush">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<h3>9. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH A PRISONER</h3>


<p>At first they decided to kill him at once, then some thought it better
to lead him to their village, that the whole tribe might rejoice in the
triumph. But, as one of the Indians shot by the Captain had in the
meantime died, the more impatient clamored for speedy vengeance. So they
bound him to a tree to use as a target.</p>

<p>Now, as the arrows began to strike dangerously near, Captain John, ever
quick-witted and resourceful, brought forth his pocket compass and
showed the Indians the dancing needle; and when they found they could
not touch it, because of the glass, they were amazed, for of course they
had never seen glass before, and could not understand it. A feeling of
awe crept over them; they thought him a magician, and were afraid to
kill him. So at last they marched him off in their midst, through the
forest, to consult with the rest of the tribe as to what should be done
with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;"><a name="prisoner" id="prisoner">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<h3>10. THE DANCE OF VICTORY</h3>


<p>They carried their prisoner from village to village, while at every
moment he looked for death, until at last they came to their great town,
Werowacomo, where king Powhatan lived. And here they celebrated their
victory by savage pomps and conjurations. They tied the Captain to the
ceremonial stake, then, all painted and decorated in their fiercest and
most hideous war paint and trappings, they danced their wild dance of
triumph. Shouting and jumping, they brandished their war clubs in his
face, whirling round and round their captive, like so many demons, each
more frightful than the other. But, since they did not kill him at once,
Captain John, nothing daunted, kept them wondering, by telling strange
stories of the sun, the stars, and the world over the sea, and though
the Indians could understand but little they hesitated, one day feasting
him, and the next threatening to kill.</p>

<p>Now Pocahontas felt sorry for the handsome young stranger, and was drawn
to him, and taught him many words of the Indian tongue, and he told her
of his people beyond the sea, as best he could, and so they became good
friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;"><a name="dance" id="dance">

<h3>11-12. POCAHONTAS SAVES CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH'S LIFE</h3>


<p>At last, after long deliberation, the Indians decided that, since he had
killed one of their tribe, Captain John must die, for this was their
law. So they dragged him, bound, before the great chief Powhatan, who
sat in mighty state surrounded by his warriors. They stretched the
prisoner on the ground with his head on a large stone, to beat out his
brains with their cruel clubs. And it seemed as though at last the
gallant Captain's time had come. But just as the Indian brave was about
to strike, his great war club swinging high in the air, Pocahontas
rushed forward and threw herself between him and his victim. With her
own body she shielded the Captain from harm, for her heart was moved to
pity for the stranger, and she could not bear that he should die. And
now aroused, with flashing eyes she waved the executioner back. Then she
pleaded with her father that the captive's life be spared.</p>

<p>At once there was wild confusion of shouting and threatening, many
crying, "Kill, kill!" while but few were willing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> spare his life, for
the Indians feared the white men, and wished to drive them from the
land.</p>

<p>But Pocahontas, as Princess of the tribe, claimed her right, and would
not yield them up their victim. Then Powhatan, who ruled them all,
raised his hand and stopped their clamor. In sullen silence the angry
warriors awaited his decision. For a moment he hesitated, and the fate
of Captain John hung wavering in the balance. Then, to please his
favorite daughter, whom he dearly loved, he decreed that she should have
her will.</p>

<p>"Let Pocahontas keep the stranger as her own, to make her toys," he
said, for Captain John, during the idle days of weary captivity, had
often whittled curious playthings for the little maid.</p>

<p>And thus was Captain John Smith's life saved by the gentle Indian girl,
and with it the Jamestown colony, for without their sturdy and
resourceful leader the settlers would have lost courage and abandoned
the town.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h3>13. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH AGAIN FREE</h3>


<p>Now, after much feasting, and with savage rite and ceremony, Powhatan
adopted the Captain into the tribe, and made him a chief, and told him
that he might come and go in safety, as one of them; then gave him
guides to take him back to Jamestown, that the red man and the white
should henceforth be friends, since Pocahontas willed it so.</p>

<p>And Captain John thanked the maiden for the great service she had done
him, and, like a gallant knight of old, bent his knee and kissed her
hand as he bade her good-by.</p>

<p>Once again in Jamestown, he found the colony in disorder and panic. All
were on the point of sailing for home, completely disheartened, for they
thought him dead, and feared the Indians. But again he put life into the
enterprise, and set the faint-hearted to work, freed from the fear of
Indian attack, since Pocahontas stood his friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<h3>14. POCAHONTAS BRINGS FOOD TO THE COLONISTS</h3>


<p>Later, when the settlers were in sore straits for food, for they were
improvident, and managed badly, Pocahontas, always generous and
friendly, learning of their needs, came with her brother Nantaquaus and
her Indians bringing corn, and kept them from starving, while their own
was growing. Captain John in return gave her beads and trinkets to deck
herself, and called her his child, and a firm friendship grew between
them. Often she came and went, bringing peace and welcome food, quite at
home in the little streets of Jamestown. And Captain John Smith in his
writings has said that without her help in times of dire need, and
without her influence for peace, the feeble colony must surely have
perished, either by famine or by the hands of her savage kindred. Much
we owe to the Indian maid who helped so greatly in the early struggles
of the founders of this great nation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;"><a name="food" id="food">
<img src="./images/i031-1.jpg" width="80%" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h3>15. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH GOES IN SEARCH OF CORN</h3>


<p>This pleasant state, however, did not last, for, as the settlers became
more firmly fixed in the land, the Indians, fickle and changeable, grew
jealous and resented their intrusion, and refused to sell corn, hoping
by this means to force them away.</p>

<p>Once when Captain John Smith was compelled to go to them in search of
food in the dead of winter, and to break his way through the ice of the
frozen river, they received him coldly, with lowering looks, and only
Pocahontas bade him welcome.</p>

<p>Finally Powhatan joined the discontented, and plotted to destroy Captain
John and his friends by treachery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;"><a name="search" id="search">
<img src="./images/i033-1.jpg" width="80%" alt="" title="" /></a>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h3>16. POCAHONTAS'S WARNING</h3>


<p>To carry out his plan the crafty chief proposed to the Captain that, as
now they were all friends, he and his party should leave their weapons
in the boat. He hoped thus to attack the white men while they were
unarmed.</p>

<p>But Captain John was too cautious a soldier to agree to this, and
answered that, since, as Powhatan had well said, they were all friends,
there could be no harm in keeping their guns with them, as the settlers
considered them a part of their dress. Then Powhatan planned to surprise
them by night. But, just as his trap was well laid, Pocahontas, risking
her own life, stole silently through the deep woods in the dark, cold
night, to the Captain's tent, and, with tears in her eyes, warned him of
his danger, urging him to fly.</p>

<p>Thus forewarned he was on his guard, and, with his soldiers, beat back
his enemies when they came, and even forced them to bring the much
needed corn, by threatening to destroy their village.</p>

<p>And so Pocahontas saved Captain John Smith's life for the second time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h3>17. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH SAILS FOR ENGLAND</h3>


<p>Always watchful and brave, Captain John Smith worked zealously to make
the colony a success. One day, while returning from treating with the
Indians for a new and better site for Jamestown, he was seriously
injured by the accidental explosion of a bag of gunpowder in his boat.
His clothes were set on fire and he had to throw himself into the river
to escape being burned to death.</p>

<p>His wounds were so grievous that he could no longer govern the colony,
and was forced to sail for England, in a ship just leaving, to seek the
help of a surgeon.</p>

<p>On that day Pocahontas, having heard of the accident, came to the town
with Nantaquaus, to see him. They were only in time to watch the ship
bearing Captain John sail away toward the open sea. Pocahontas little
dreamed that years would pass before they should meet again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<h3>18. POCAHONTAS IS CAPTURED BY ARGALL</h3>


<p>From this day, having lost their leader, things went badly with the
Jamestown colonists, for the dissatisfied Indians, no longer fearing the
heavy hand of Captain John Smith, attacked the settlers, and caused them
serious losses.</p>

<p>And Pocahontas came no more, but waited for his coming again, and waited
in vain. So time passed, and at last she heard that he was dead, for
this was the rumor in the land. And she grieved deeply, and sat often
alone thinking of him, for she had grown to love her warrior Captain.
Some two years after Captain John's departure, came Argall, an
unscrupulous man, who plotted to capture Pocahontas and hold her as a
hostage, to keep the fighting savages quiet. With the help of two
treacherous Indians she was induced to come on board his ship, and once
there was seized and held prisoner.</p>

<p>Powhatan mourned his daughter's loss, and tried to ransom her, but the
crafty Argall would not give her up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h3>19. THE MARRIAGE OF POCAHONTAS</h3>


<p>She was never allowed to go back to her people, though Nantaquaus came
often to see her at Jamestown. And here she grew to be a woman, and
learned the ways of the English women, and dressed as they did.</p>

<p>At last a young Englishman, John Rolfe, captivated by her dark beauty
and gentle ways, wooed the Indian maid, and as years had passed since
Captain John had gone away, and she had long since thought him dead, she
listened to Rolfe, and consented to marry him, that peace might reign
between her people and the white men.</p>

<p>So they were married in the Jamestown church, and Nantaquaus and a body
of chiefs from her tribe, as well as all the settlers, came to the
wedding. There was great joy in the town, for now the colonists felt
that a good understanding with the Indians was at last established. And
Pocahontas, as before, was the tie that bound them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h3>20. THE LANDING OF POCAHONTAS IN ENGLAND</h3>


<p>After this the colony prospered. Pocahontas became contented with her
life in the town. And in time a son was born to her. Later, Rolfe, with
his wife and child, sailed to visit England. Pocahontas marveled much at
the extent of the great sea, and the many ships upon its waves.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Plymouth the governor of the town came down to bid
the Indian Princess welcome to England.</p>

<p>With her, as attendant, went Uttamatomakkin, a shrewd old chief, who, in
his war feathers and Indian robes, attracted much attention. He had been
sent by Powhatan to count the English, that he might learn their
strength. And he was to cut a notch in a stick for every man he saw. He
worked hard and fast, but a whole bundle of sticks was notched before he
got even to London, where, with a disgusted grunt, he gave up the task.
"Too many," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<h3>21-22. POCAHONTAS AT THE COURT OF JAMES THE FIRST</h3>


<p>Pocahontas's stay in England became almost a triumphal march. Everywhere
she was received with great honor as a foreign Princess, and entertained
with banquets and receptions, and taken to the theatres to see the
plays.</p>

<p>Finally she was presented at court by Lord and Lady Delaware, and
formally welcomed with great pomp and ceremony by King James and his
queen, surrounded by their following of lords and ladies, all arrayed in
their rich costumes of state. And none of the haughty ladies was prouder
or more stately than the Indian bride. Throughout London town her
welcome was the same. The people were curious to see this dark Princess
from another world. And even the high bishops, and the great lords and
ladies, came down in their stately coaches to visit her at her house in
Branford.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>To compliment her, many taverns and inns were named "La Belle Sauvage,"
a name still to be found on old London signs.</p>

<p>And as she had done so much to help the struggling English colonists
across the sea, all wished to show their gratitude by greetings, and
festivals in her honor. Old Uttamatomakkin received his share of
attention as well. In his wild dress, with his tawny skin and shining
black hair, he was a strange sight to those who had never before seen a
red American. He was not at all impressed by the king and his richly
dressed nobles, and wondered how they could endure so many clothes, and
greatly preferred his own simple dress, made from the skins of the wild
beasts of his forests.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<h3>23. THE MEETING OF POCAHONTAS AND CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH</h3>


<p>And now Captain John Smith, who, during all this time, had been on long
voyages of exploration and adventure, hearing that Pocahontas had come
to England, remembered the old times and all that the little Indian maid
had done for him, and so, attended by some friends, he went down to
Branford to greet her. When Pocahontas saw him a flood of recollection
overcame her, and she was greatly moved. She turned from him, hiding her
face in her hand, and for a long time could not speak. At last she said,
"They told me you were dead."</p>

<p>Then she reproached him for calling her the Lady Rebecca, the name given
her since her marriage, and told him that he should call her child, as
he used to do, and said, "You did promise Powhatan what was yours should
be his, and he the like to you: you called him father, being in his land
a stranger, and by the same reason so must I do you."</p>

<p>But Captain John excused himself, saying, "I durst not now allow of that
title, since the King commands that you be treated as a Princess."</p>

<p>Then Pocahontas answered, "You were not afraid to come into my father's
country, and to cause fear in him and all his people but me, and fear
you here I should call you father? I tell you then I will, and you shall
call me child. And so I will be forever and ever your countryman."</p>

<p>And then, when Pocahontas had grown calmer, these two, after years of
separation, again sat together, and talked long of the old days in
Virginia.</p>

<p>Uttamatomakkin, glad to see an old friend in this strange land, told how
he had been commanded by Powhatan to seek out Captain John, to know the
truth, if he still lived, for they could not believe all the rumors they
heard concerning him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<h3>24. CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH GOES TO SEA AGAIN</h3>


<p>After this meeting Captain John became more restless than ever, and soon
set sail again. And when alone upon the deck of his ship he thought
often of the Virginia colony for which he had toiled, and risked so
much, and of Pocahontas, and of her help in his time of need. No doubt
he saw again before him the little Indian girl who had saved his life,
and the maid who brought him succor, and, when the time came, saved him
once more by her warning. And his heart was warmed with gratitude, and
he wished her happiness in her new life. But always for him ambition and
action called. So he sailed away to help found new colonies, this time
to that part of America which he named New England, and where he opened
the way for the Pilgrim Fathers, who afterwards built a new Plymouth in
the new world. From Jamestown and Plymouth other colonies spread along
the coast, until in time they joined hands and formed a new nation, the
United States of America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h3>25. POCAHONTAS LONGS FOR HOME</h3>


<p>When Captain John had gone, the thoughts of Pocahontas more than ever
turned toward home, and she wearied of the crowded English land, and
longed for her native forests again. Daily she gazed from her window
toward the west, where lay Virginia, and her early life. And she pined,
and thought much of the old days in her native wilds, when into her
sunny life came the golden-haired stranger, with his people, and of the
great changes that had befallen her and her race through that coming.</p>

<p>She often talked with old Uttamatomakkin of Virginia, and of Captain
John, and grew more and more homesick, till her husband became alarmed
lest she fall ill from longing, and he tried to hasten their departure.
They journeyed down to Gravesend, where their ship was lying, but were
compelled to wait while it took on supplies for Jamestown.</p>

<p>At last, however, the good news was brought that the ship was ready.
Preparations were quickly made for the long voyage, and the day was
set.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<h3>26. THE END OF THE STORY OF POCAHONTAS</h3>


<p>Though the ship lay ready in the offing, and the sailors had come to
convey them on board, and though at last Pocahontas had turned her face
toward home, alas! it was not to be. A sudden weakness overcame her, and
gently, looking toward the setting sun and Virginia, she quietly fell
asleep,&mdash;to rest forever in a foreign land.</p>

<p>From her son, who years after returned to the land of his birth, many
proud families still trace their descent. As long as Virginia lives her
name will be dear to that state. And for us all, who have inherited this
great land, this first page of a nation's history, the story of
Pocahontas and Captain John Smith, with its echo of primitive days, its
romance and dangers, its daring courage and perseverance, will always
mean more than simply a tale of adventure of the little Indian girl and
the gallant soldier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
